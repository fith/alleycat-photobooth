NeoBand NFC Reader Server Setup Instructions Slave
Mode vs Master Mode
NeoBand NFC Reader Setup Instructions: Slave Mode vs Master Mode
Overview
The uFR Zero Online NFC Reader supports two primary operating modes: Slave Mode and Master
Mode. Each serves different use cases. This guide outlines:
The differences between them
When to use each
How to configure your server accordingly
How to read NeoBand tag data using your app’s existing sector/block mapping and keys
Field Sector Block Description
name 39 0 Username (hex → text)
role 1 0 Role: "hunger" or "bounty"
allegiance 39 1 Allegiance (hex → text)
faction - - From sector index (1–31)
neo id - - Card UID (from GetCardIdEx Key Concepts
Mapped Block-by-Block Payload Example
When parsing data from the NeoBand, here’s a sample layout and what your server should extract:
)
You can extract each using BlockInSectorRead and parse the Data hex string using UTF-8 decoding.
Combine this with UID from GetCardIdEx to build the full identity payload for each tag scan.
Expected Server Data Output
When reading NeoBands from the reader, the expected payload your server should collect and parse
includes:
name (from Sector 39)
role ("hunger" or "bounty", usually in Sector 1 for Alleycat)
allegiance (Sector 36–38, depending on user)
faction (identified by sector, e.g., Sector 1 = Alleycat)
neo id (typically the UID or a system-generated ID)
You can extract these using a series of BlockInSectorRead calls combined with hex-to-text decoding.
The NeoBand App uses MIFARE Classic EV1 4K tags.
Tag data is structured according to the FIELD_MAP in your map.js :
Sectors 1–31 → Factions (e.g., Sector 1 = Alleycat)
Sectors 36–38 → Allegiances
Sector 39 → User data (e.g., Username, Allegiance ID)
Key usage:
Key A (Read): A0A1A2A3A4A5 (universal)
Key B (Write): Faction-specific; e.g., Alleycat uses 010101010101 for writing
Note: All server reads will use Key A for authentication ( A0A1A2A3A4A5 ) and Auth mode 0x60
Option 1: Slave Mode (Recommended for app + server
control)
When to Use
When you want both the NeoBand app and a local server to independently issue commands to the
reader
When the server needs to read full tag data (e.g., username + faction fields)
How It Works
Reader passively accepts HTTP or WebSocket connections
You send commands like BlockInSectorRead over /shell
Server Command Example: Read Role (Alleycat - Sector 1 Block 0)
const response = await fetch(`http://<READER_IP>/shell`
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
body: "BlockInSectorRead 1 0 96 A0A1A2A3A4A5"
});
const data = await response.json();
, {
// Convert hex data to UTF-8 text
toText = (hex) => Buffer.from(hex.replace(/^0x/,
�+$/,
'')
console.log("[Role - hunger/bounty]:", toText(data.Data));
```ts
const response = await fetch(`http://<READER_IP>/shell`, {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
body: "BlockInSectorRead 1 0 96 A0A1A2A3A4A5"
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log("[Alleycat Field 1]:", data.Data);
''), 'hex').toString('utf-8').replace(/
Server Command Example: Read Name (Sector 39 Block 0)
const response = await fetch("http://<READER_IP>/shell", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
body: "BlockInSectorRead 39 0 96 A0A1A2A3A4A5"
});
const data = await response.json();
toText = (hex) => Buffer.from(hex.replace(/^0x/,
�+$/,
'')
console.log("[Name]:", toText(data.Data));
''), 'hex').toString('utf-8').replace(/
Server Command Example: Read Allegiance (Sector 39 Block 1)
const response = await fetch("http://<READER_IP>/shell", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
body: "BlockInSectorRead 39 1 96 A0A1A2A3A4A5"
});
const data = await response.json();
toText = (hex) => Buffer.from(hex.replace(/^0x/,
�+$/,
'')
console.log("[Allegiance]:", toText(data.Data));
''), 'hex').toString('utf-8').replace(/
Server Command Example: Read UID (Neo ID)
const response = await fetch("http://<READER_IP>/shell", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
body: "GetCardIdEx"
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log("[Neo ID - Card UID]:", data.CardUid?.replace(/^0x/,
data.Data);
'').toUpperCase() ||
```ts
const response = await fetch("http://<READER_IP>/shell", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
body: "BlockInSectorRead 39 0 96 A0A1A2A3A4A5"
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log("[Username Hex]:", data.Data);
Configuration Checklist
Reader Mode: Slave
Enable /shell HTTP interface
Ensure WebSocket server is enabled (optional for UID pushes)
Make sure no HID or Transparent modes are enabled
Option 2: Master Mode (Push Mode)
When to Use
When you want the reader to push card UID info to a server without any external request
When you don’t need full field data, just tag detection
How It Works
Reader becomes a client and pushes UID + event data to your server
You cannot send commands like BlockRead — only receive UID
Server Setup Example
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post("/reader-event", (req, res) => {
console.log("Reader pushed UID:", req.body);
res.sendStatus(200);
});
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Listening on port 3000"));
Example Push Payload
{
"CardUid": "49C64833",
"CardType": 33,
"Event": "CARD_DETECTED"
}
Configuration Checklist
Reader Mode: Master
Destination URL: http://<your-server-ip>:3000/reader-event
Push UID on Card Present: Enabled
Cannot use /shell HTTP in this mode
Summary Table
Feature Slave Mode Master Mode
Server sends read commands ✅ Yes ❌ No
Reader pushes UID to server ⚠ Optional ✅ Yes
Full field data access ✅ Yes ❌ UID only
Compatible with NeoBand App ✅ Yes ⚠ Not simultaneously

Example Server Module (Reusable Read & Decode Function)
Unified NeoBand Payload Reader
const toText = (hex) => Buffer.from(hex.replace(/^0x/,
8').replace(/�+$/,
'');
''), 'hex').toString('utf-
async function readNeoBandPayload(readerIp = '<READER_IP>') {
const keyA = 'A0A1A2A3A4A5';
const commands = [
{ name: 'role', sector: 1, block: 0 },
{ name: 'name', sector: 39, block: 0 },
{ name: 'allegiance', sector: 39, block: 1 }
];
const payload = {};
for (const cmd of commands) {
const command =
`BlockInSectorRead ${cmd.sector} ${cmd.block} 96 ${keyA}`;
const res = await fetch(`http://${readerIp}/shell`
, {
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
body: command
});
const json = await res.json();
payload[cmd.name] = toText(json.Data || '');
}
// Get UID (Neo ID)
const uidRes = await fetch(`http://${readerIp}/shell`
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
body: 'GetCardIdEx'
, {
});
const uidJson = await uidRes.json();
payload.neoId = uidJson.CardUid?.replace(/^0x/,
'').toUpperCase() || uidJson.Data || null;
payload.faction = 'faction1'; // Determined based on source sector logic
return payload;
}
This function reads all necessary fields from a tag and returns a structured object:
{
"role": "bounty",
"name": "looloouser56",
"allegiance": "IronBlade",
"neoId": "49C64833",
"faction": "faction1"
}
Use this as your foundation for syncing to a database, session tracker, or dispatch handler.
async function readBlock(sector, block, readerIp = "192.168.0.11") {
const keyA = "A0A1A2A3A4A5";
const command =
`BlockInSectorRead ${sector} ${block} 96 ${keyA}`;
const response = await fetch(`http://${readerIp}/shell`
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
body: command
});
, {
const json = await response.json();
if (json.Status?.includes("UFR_OK")) {
return json.Data;
} else {
throw new Error("Reader error: " + json.Status);
}
}
Best Practice
For full app/server control and complete field access, use Slave Mode
For minimal UID logging, use Master Mode
All server reads should use Key A: A0A1A2A3A4A5 and Auth mode 0x60
Do not attempt write operations unless you have the correct Key B for the sector (e.g.,
010101010101 for Alleycat write)

/**
* @file map.js
* @description MIFARE Classic 4K Memory Map and Field Definitions
*
* This file defines the memory layout and field mappings for the Neoband App,
* specifically designed for MIFARE Classic 4K cards. The mapping follows strict
* MIFARE Classic memory structure constraints and D-Logic SDK requirements.
*
* Memory Structure:
* - MIFARE Classic 4K has 40 sectors (numbered 0-39)
* - Each sector has multiple blocks:
* - Sectors 0-31: 4 blocks each (0-3)
* - Sectors 32-39: 16 blocks each (0-15)
* - Block 3 in each sector is the "trailer" block (contains keys and access bits)
* - Only data blocks (0-2) are used for storing field values
*
* Field Mapping Rules:
* 1. Factions use sectors 1-15 and 17-31 (30 factions total)
* - Each faction gets 3 fields (blocks 0-2 in their sector)
* - Sector 16 is reserved (skipped as per CSV)
* 2. Allegiances use sectors 36-38
* - Each allegiance spans 5 consecutive sectors
* - Only blocks 0-2 are used in each sector
* 3. User data (username) uses sector 39, block 0
*
* Authentication:
* - All operations use the same authentication key (FFFFFFFFFFFF)
* - Each block requires fresh authentication before access
*
* @version 3.0.4
* @lastUpdated 2025-04-12
*/
// Global authentication key used for all sectors
const NFC_KEY = "FFFFFFFFFFFF";
/**
* FIELD_MAP defines the complete memory layout for all factions, allegiances,
* and user data. Each field includes:
*
* @property {string} name - Display name for the faction/allegiance
* @property {number} sector - MIFARE sector number (0-39)
* @property {Object} fields - Collection of data fields for this faction/allegiance
* @property {Object} fields.fieldN - Individual field definition
* @property {string} fields.fieldN.title - Display title for the field
* @property {string} fields.fieldN.placeholder - Input placeholder text
* @property {number} fields.fieldN.sector - MIFARE sector number for this field
* @property {number} fields.fieldN.block - Block number within the sector (0-2)
* @property {string} fields.fieldN.key - Authentication key for this block
